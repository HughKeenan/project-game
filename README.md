# Project Game
Project Game is a gaming related news website modelled on sites such as Reddit and the Escapist where the site owner and registered users can post stories (called threads) about news from the games industry or anything else related to the topic of video games. The goal is to provide a space where those with an interest in gaming can discuss it and get to know other hobbyists.

## UX Design:
This site has been designed to have a simple easy to understand layout. The target user is anyone interested in gaming of any age who wishes to discuss their hobby and developments in the industry.

## Features


### Colours and typography
The colour scheme of the site was inspired by that of the forums on escapistmagazine.com. This was chosen because the colours are not distracting but provide a high enough contrast that everything is easily readable. Colours such as these are often used as standard in games consoles and websites, making the website more thematic.

Pixelify Sans was used for the site logo as it provides a thematic way to present the site without compromising on readability. Gill Sans was chosen for the main body elements, Nanum Gothic for the footer and Rubik for the links to threads and the names of who posted a given entry. This variance of font styles on the page allowed elements to be visually distinct without becoming distracting.
